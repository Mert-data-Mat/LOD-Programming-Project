What we learned: 
Mert :
Implementing functions like get_valid_moves(), is_in_check(), and is_checkmate() helped me understand how complex systems can be broken down into smaller parts and i learned how to use dictionaries.
Betul :
I worked with 2d lists to represent the chessboard, debugged movement errors when implementing piece movement rules, learned how to draw a chessboard using pygame library functions.
Yusuf:
Learned how to store and retrieve data using JSON. Learned pygame libraries basics, especially real-time user interactions like capturing mouse clicks.
